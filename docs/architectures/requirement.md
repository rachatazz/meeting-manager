# Goal

Build a simple Meeting Manager web application where users can create, update, delete, and list meetings.

## Requirements

### Core Features

- A user can add a new meeting (title, description, due date, status).
- A user can view a list of meetings (with pagination or infinite scroll).
- A user can edit a meeting (change title, description, due date, status).
- A user can delete a meeting.
- Meetings should persist (in memory, JSON file, SQLite, or DB — your choice).

### Technical Requirements

- Frontend: Use React or Vue. Styling is up to you.
- Backend: Use Node.js with Express or Python with FastAPI/Flask.
- Provide a simple REST API for CRUD operations.(DB can mockup)
- Include a README with setup instructions.
- Containerized the web for deployment (Including Frontend, Backend, and Database).
- Deploy the app (e.g., on Vercel/Render/Heroku/Docker).

### Bonus

- Add user authentication (login/logout).
- UI Design (e.g., Figma, Adobe XD, Sketch, Penpot) is a plus (Optional).
- Add tests (unit or integration).
- CI/CD flow for testing and deployment. (e.g., GitHub Action) (Optional)

### Deliverables

- GitHub repo with code, clear commit history, and README.
- GitHub should be publicly accessible.
- Instructions to run locally.

### Time Expectation

- Spent about 1 week.It doesn’t need to be perfect, just demonstrate how you approach structuring and building software.
